To access the EC2 instances:
1. The private key has been saved to: ./{{ project_name }}_ed25519
2. SSH to an instance: ssh -i ./{{ project_name }}_ed25519 ec2-user@<public-ip>
   (Replace <public-ip> with the actual public IP of the instance)

{% for host_type in instances.keys() %}
{{ host_type | capitalize }} server public IP(s):
{% for instance in ec2_instances.results %}
{% if instance.item.0 == host_type and instance.instance_ids %}
  - {{ instance.instances[0].public_ip_address }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

Ansible inventory file has been generated at: ./inventory.ini

Ansible Automation Platform Details:
1. A new inventory "{{ aap_inventory_name }}" has been created with the EC2 instances.
2. A machine credential "{{ project_name }}-machine-credential" has been created for accessing the instances.
3. A new project "{{ project_name }}-project" has been set up with the dummy GitHub URL.
4. A job template "{{ project_name }}-job-template" has been created, linking the project, inventory, and credential.

You can now log in to your Ansible Automation Platform at {{ aap_hostname }} to view and manage these resources.
